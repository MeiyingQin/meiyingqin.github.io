* 2020-05-27 A meida report in Chinese by Sina on my Animal Robot Interaction paper can be found: <https://tech.sina.cn/2020-05-27/detail-iirczymk3752699.d.html>. For more details on the research, please click [here](/Research/Robotics/Animal_Robot_Interactions/main.html). Note: Aibo was not included in the study because we do not have access to an Aibo. Aibo with proper behaviours is considered as a social robot. In a previous study mentioned in my paper, although only for a few seconds, dogs did display social responses as if they were interacting with another dog.
