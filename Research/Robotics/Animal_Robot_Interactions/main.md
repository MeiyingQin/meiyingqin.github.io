Robots (e.g., social robots, or other robots like Roombas) are more prevalent at home. In this study, I explored whether dogs could respond to a social robot.

* The paper ([pdf](/assets/pdf/dog_sit_study.pdf)) is published at alt. HRI 2020.

* Here is a video presentation of the study.

* A media article, which is also a very good summary of this work, can be found: <https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/dogs-obey-commands-given-by-social-robots>. Note: Aibo was not included in the study because we do not have access to an Aibo. Aibo with proper behaviours is considered as a social robot. In a previous study mentioned in my paper, although only for a few seconds, dogs did display social responses as if they were interacting with another dog.
