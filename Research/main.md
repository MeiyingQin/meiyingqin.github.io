# Topic 1: Robot Tool Use

In a collection of projects, I explored and I will continue to explore how to enable robots to use tools. The finished work is now under review. I will add more imformation once I hear back some good news!

# Topic 2: [Animal Robot Interactions](/Research/Robotics/Animal_Robot_Interactions/main.html)

Robots (e.g., social robots, or other robots like Roombas) are more prevalent at home. In this study, I explored whether dogs could respond to a social robot. For more details, please click [here](/Research/Robotics/Animal_Robot_Interactions/main.html).

# Topic 3: [Socially Assistive Robots (SAR)](/Research/Robotics/Socially_Assistive_Robots/main.html)

Studied showed that social robots improves the social skills in children with Autism with a short interaction. In this study, we explored how long--term interactions could benefit the children. For more information, please click [here](/Research/Robotics/Socially_Assistive_Robots/main.html)

# Topic 4: [Animal Cognition](/Research/Animal_Cognition/Zebrafish_Methodology/main.html)

During my undergraduate studies, I did research on animal cognitions. I have worked on a few projects with different species. To see the projects and some cute animal pictures, please click [here](/Research/Animal_Cognition/projects.html).

Here is a project on zebrafish. Zebrafish are social animals, and they love shoaling with their peers. A group of zebrafish is thus used as rewards to train a zebrafish with classical conditioning. Zebrafish is a model animal, which is used to diseases such as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Zebrafish with FAS may dislike shoaling with other zebrafish. I developed a software to show different vitual stimulus of zebrafish, and conducted a methodology study whether healthy zebrafish loving shoaling to the virtual stimulus.

I also followed up this study by developing a zebrafish tracking software (both online and offline) to enable operaional conditioning possible in zebrafish studies.
