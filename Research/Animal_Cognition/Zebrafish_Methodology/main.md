Zebrafish are social animals, and they love shoaling with their peers. A group of zebrafish is thus used as rewards to train a zebrafish with classical conditioning. Zebrafish is a model animal, which is used to diseases such as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Zebrafish with FAS may dislike shoaling with other zebrafish. I developed a software to show different vitual stimulus of zebrafish, and conducted a methodology study whether healthy zebrafish loving shoaling to the virtual stimulus. The paper ([pdf](/assets/pdf/zebrafish.pdf)) was published on the [Zebrafish joural](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/zeb.2013.0969).

I also followed up this study by developing a zebrafish tracking software (both online and offline) to enable operaional conditioning possible in zebrafish studies. Here is an illustration of how to use the software, and a demo. In the demo, I used a zebrafish video. However, this software has been tested with live tracking and the results are the same.
