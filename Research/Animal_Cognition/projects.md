I have worked on a few projects on animal cognition:

* Zebrafish, at [Gerlai Lab](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/gerlai-lab/home)

* Macaques, at the Developmental and Comparative Psychology Lab at Peking University

(Ada, the macaque in the picture, refused to continue the experiment unless I shake ... feet.)

* Pandas, at Peking University Center for Nature and Society

(I was trained to be able to distinguish 6 different pandas.)
