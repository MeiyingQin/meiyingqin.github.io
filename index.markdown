<p> <font size="10"> Hi! </font> </p>


I am Meiying Qin, a current Ph.D Candidate at the [Social Robotics Lab at Yale](https://scazlab.yale.edu/) under the supervision of [Brian Scassellati](https://scazlab.yale.edu/people/brian-scassellati). For more information about me, please click [here](/About/main.html).

My research interest is to build **explainable** and **data-efficient** systems to enable robots to learn and apply the physical rules to interact with the environment, or even learn the social norms to interact with human. I am currently working on projects on tool using in robots. With the understanding of the physical world, the robot can collaborate with human better. The inspirations of a lot of my work comes from animal cognitions. To learn more about my research, please click [here](/Research/main.html).

I compiled some useful tools and resources [here](/Useful_Tools/main.html) on robotics or on academic research in general. I hope this could to remove some barriers for people who would like to learn more about robotics or start a career in robotics. I will update the information as I learn more about robotics myself.

If you would like to know more about my personal life, I would love to share it with you [here](/Personal/main.html).
